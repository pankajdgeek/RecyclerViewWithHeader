# Recyclerview with header

This a sample project for showing the Recyclerview with Header. We have taken an example where we can have a list of data with categories. So we are showing categories in TabLayout and in Recyclerview we show the list of items under the category header.

## Benifits of using tablayout with recyclerview

* Easy to navigate if we have a long list of an item under a single category.
* Categories are visible without scrolling through the whole list.

## View components used  

* Recyclerview -> Display item list with category header.
* TabLayout -> Display list of category.

## Language

* Kotlin
